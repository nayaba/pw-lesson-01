### Lesson 1: Introduction to JavaScript

#### What is JavaScript?

- **JavaScript (JS)** is a programming language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.
- It's a client-side language, which means it runs in your web browser without the need for a server.
- It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) you are already familiar with.

#### How Does JavaScript Work with HTML and CSS?

- **HTML** is the structure of your website, like the skeleton of a human body.
- **CSS** is the style of your website, akin to the clothes and accessories that make the look of the body.
- **JavaScript** is the behavior, similar to the muscles that move and react to what’s around.

Alright, future coders! Let’s get you set up in a nifty playground where you can practice the cool stuff we'll be learning. There’s this awesome tool called CodePen – think of it as your personal digital sandbox. You can build and test snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the fuss of setting up a full development environment. It’s perfect for trying out the concepts from our lessons.

### Step 1: Meet CodePen.io

First things first, head over to [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io). You’ll land on a page full of creative pens (that’s what they call the projects) created by others. It’s like walking into an art gallery of code!

### Step 2: Sign Up or Dive In

You can start without an account, but if you want to save your masterpieces, you’ll need to sign up. It’s free, and it means you get to keep a collection of your work.

### Step 3: Create a New Pen

Once you’re ready, click on the “Create” button on the top right and select “New Pen.” Boom! You’re now looking at your very own Pen. You’ll see three boxes: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is where you’ll drop your code.

### Step 4: Coding in the Panels

- **HTML Panel**: Start with the HTML panel. It’s just like writing HTML on any webpage. Create a `<button>` or a `<div>` to see your JavaScript interact with the page.
- **CSS Panel**: Make it pretty with the CSS panel. Style your HTML elements here. Change colors, sizes, and more.
- **JavaScript Panel**: Here’s where the magic happens. Write your JavaScript code in this panel to bring your page to life.

### Step 5: See It in Action

As you type in your code, CodePen renders it in real-time. That means you can see your changes live as you code. Made a button in HTML? Watch it appear. Styled it in CSS? See the colors pop. Added an `alert` in JavaScript? Prepare for the popup!

### Step 6: Save and Share

Hit the “Save & Close” button to keep your changes. Got something cool to show? Share your Pen with others by sending them the link. It’s like showing off your latest Lego build.

### Step 7: Fork and Learn

Found a Pen by someone else that you like? You can “Fork” it (which is just a fancy way of saying “make a copy”), and then play around with it. It’s a great way to learn!

### Running JavaScript Locally

Now, about running JavaScript on your local machine: You can write JavaScript code in a text file, save it with a `.js` extension, and run it through your terminal using Node.js. But hey, we’re going to tackle that together in class, and it's a bit more advanced. For now, stick to CodePen, and we’ll go over the terminal stuff step by step, so don’t you worry.

### Quick Tips for Using CodePen

- **Auto-saving**: CodePen auto-saves your work as you go along. So, take a breather; your code’s not going anywhere.
- **Console**: Want to see outputs from your JavaScript like `console.log()`? CodePen has a console at the bottom of the screen. It's like hearing the echo when you shout into a canyon.
- **Settings**: Want to include a JavaScript library like jQuery? Click on the gear icon in the JS panel and include it from there. It’s like adding sprinkles to your ice cream.

### Wrapping Up

Think of CodePen as your digital canvas and feel free to paint with code. It’s a place to experiment, make mistakes, and discover solutions. I’ll be guiding you through using CodePen in class, so we’ll get plenty of practice together.

And before you know it, you’ll be writing JavaScript like it’s your native language. Get ready to create, explore, and have a blast with code! 🚀🎨
