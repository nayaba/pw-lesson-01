## Lesson 1: Introduction to JavaScript

#### What is JavaScript?

- **JavaScript (JS)** is a programming language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more.
- It's a client-side language, which means it runs in your web browser without the need for a server.
- It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) you are already familiar with.

#### How Does JavaScript Work with HTML and CSS?

- **HTML** is the structure of your website, like the skeleton of a human body.
- **CSS** is the style of your website, akin to the clothes and accessories that make the look of the body.
- **JavaScript** is the behavior, similar to the muscles that move and react to what‚Äôs around.

###  Introduction to JavaScript as a Standalone Language

#### Understanding JavaScript's Flexibility

JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used in various environments. While it's commonly associated with web development in combination with HTML and CSS, it can also run independently on the command line (aka in the [Terminal](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-dev-tools#the-terminal-your-command-center)), or on a server, using environments like Node.js. This lesson focuses on JavaScript itself, not its interaction with HTML and CSS.

#### The JavaScript Engine

- **What is it?** A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code. Every major web browser has its own engine, for example, Google Chrome has V8.
- **Node.js**: This is a runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on a server or your local machine's command line.

#### Writing JavaScript Without HTML/CSS

- **Standalone Scripts**: You can write and execute JavaScript without a browser, using just a text editor and a JavaScript runtime like Node.js.
  
#### Basic JavaScript Elements

1. **[Syntax](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-lesson-03)**: The set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured JavaScript programs.

2. **[Comments](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-lesson-03#comments-your-codes-sidekick)**: Notes that explain the code and are ignored when running it.

3. **[Console](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-lesson-02)**: Where you'll see messages, errors, or any output from your code.

4. **[Variables](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-lesson-04)**: Containers for storing data values. In modern JavaScript, `let` and `const` are used to declare variables.

5. **[Data Types](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-lesson-05)**: JavaScript has various data types, including:
   - **Strings**: Textual data
   - **Numbers**: Both integers and floating-point numbers
   - **Booleans**: True or false values
   - **Objects**: Complex data structures
   - **Arrays**: Lists of data

6. **[Operators](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-lesson-06)**: Symbols that tell the interpreter to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.

7. **[Control Structures](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-lesson-07)**: Direct the flow of the program based on conditions.


8. **[Functions](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-lesson-08)**: Blocks of code designed to perform a particular task, called upon by name.

Alright, future coders! Let‚Äôs get you set up in a nifty playground where you can practice the cool stuff we'll be learning. There‚Äôs this awesome tool called CodePen ‚Äì think of it as your personal digital sandbox. You can build and test snippets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the fuss of setting up a full development environment. It‚Äôs perfect for trying out the concepts from our lessons.

### Step 1: Meet CodePen.io

First things first, head over to [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io). You‚Äôll land on a page full of creative pens (that‚Äôs what they call the projects) created by others. It‚Äôs like walking into an art gallery of code!

### Step 2: Sign Up or Dive In

You can start without an account, but if you want to save your masterpieces, you‚Äôll need to sign up. It‚Äôs free, and it means you get to keep a collection of your work.

### Step 3: Create a New Pen

Once you‚Äôre ready, click on the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button on the top right and select ‚ÄúNew Pen.‚Äù Boom! You‚Äôre now looking at your very own Pen. You‚Äôll see three boxes: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is where you‚Äôll drop your code.

### Step 4: Coding in the Panels

- **HTML Panel**: Start with the HTML panel. It‚Äôs just like writing HTML on any webpage. Create a `<button>` or a `<div>` to see your JavaScript interact with the page.
- **CSS Panel**: Make it pretty with the CSS panel. Style your HTML elements here. Change colors, sizes, and more.
- **JavaScript Panel**: Here‚Äôs where the magic happens. Write your JavaScript code in this panel to bring your page to life.

### Step 5: See It in Action

As you type in your code, CodePen renders it in real-time. That means you can see your changes live as you code. Made a button in HTML? Watch it appear. Styled it in CSS? See the colors pop. Added an `alert` in JavaScript? Prepare for the popup!

### Step 6: Save and Share

Hit the ‚ÄúSave & Close‚Äù button to keep your changes. Got something cool to show? Share your Pen with others by sending them the link. It‚Äôs like showing off your latest Lego build.

### Step 7: Fork and Learn

Found a Pen by someone else that you like? You can ‚ÄúFork‚Äù it (which is just a fancy way of saying ‚Äúmake a copy‚Äù), and then play around with it. It‚Äôs a great way to learn!

### Running JavaScript Locally

Now, about running JavaScript on your local machine: You can write JavaScript code in a text file, save it with a `.js` extension, and run it through your terminal using Node.js. But hey, we‚Äôre going to tackle that together in class, and it's a bit more advanced. For now, stick to CodePen, and we‚Äôll go over the terminal stuff step by step, so don‚Äôt you worry.

### Quick Tips for Using CodePen

- **Auto-saving**: CodePen auto-saves your work as you go along. So, take a breather; your code‚Äôs not going anywhere.
- **Console**: Want to see outputs from your JavaScript like `console.log()`? CodePen has a console at the bottom of the screen. It's like hearing the echo when you shout into a canyon.
- **Settings**: Want to include a JavaScript library like jQuery? Click on the gear icon in the JS panel and include it from there. It‚Äôs like adding sprinkles to your ice cream.

Think of CodePen as your digital canvas and feel free to paint with code. It‚Äôs a place to experiment, make mistakes, and discover solutions. I‚Äôll be guiding you through using CodePen in class, so we‚Äôll get plenty of practice together.

And before you know it, you‚Äôll be writing JavaScript like it‚Äôs your native language. Get ready to create, explore, and have a blast with code! üöÄüé®
